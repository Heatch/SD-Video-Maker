story = """Once upon a time, in the bustling town of Wiggleville, there lived an 11-year-old boy named Oliver Spark. Oliver was like any other kid his age—he loved playing video games, hated doing homework, and had a knack for getting into mischief. But one day, something extraordinary happened that changed his life forever.

It all started on a boring Tuesday afternoon. Oliver was stuck at the local science museum on a school field trip. While most of his classmates were busy learning about dinosaurs and planets, Oliver had slipped away from the group to explore the “Super Secret Science Lab” exhibit. The sign on the door read, “Do Not Enter,” but Oliver saw it as an open invitation.

Inside the lab, strange machines whirred and buzzed, filled with all sorts of weird chemicals and gadgets. Oliver's eyes sparkled with curiosity. He tiptoed around, poking at beakers and pressing buttons, when suddenly he came across a strange-looking drink in a flask labeled “Do Not Drink.”

“Yeah, right,” Oliver muttered to himself. “That’s exactly what they want me to do.” Without thinking twice, he took a big gulp.

As soon as the liquid hit his tongue, Oliver felt a tingling sensation run through his body. His hair stood on end, his toes tingled, and his eyes flashed bright blue. Then, as quickly as it started, everything went back to normal. Oliver shrugged, thinking it was just some weird museum trick, and rejoined his class.

The next morning, as Oliver was getting ready for school, he reached for his favorite red hoodie hanging on the top shelf of his closet. But instead of jumping up to grab it, his hand stretched. And stretched. And stretched! Oliver’s arm was suddenly ten feet long! He grabbed the hoodie, and his arm snapped back to its normal length.

“What in the world?!” Oliver gasped, staring at his hand.

Throughout the day, Oliver discovered more strange things happening to him. In gym class, he accidentally lifted the entire soccer goal while trying to kick the ball. At lunch, he sneezed and a small burst of fire came out of his nose, slightly toasting his peanut butter sandwich. And during math class, he found that he could read his teacher’s mind (which mostly consisted of thoughts about cats and lasagna).

Oliver quickly realized that the strange drink he had at the museum must have given him superpowers! Excited and slightly terrified, he decided to test them out. After school, he raced home, locked himself in his room, and began experimenting.

He discovered that he could stretch like a rubber band, turn invisible (though he always left his shoes behind), and even fly—but only three feet off the ground. But his powers were unpredictable. One minute he’d have super speed, and the next, he’d accidentally turn into a small potted plant.

Despite the chaotic nature of his new abilities, Oliver was thrilled. He started calling himself “The Amazing Oliver,” dreaming of all the heroic deeds he could accomplish. But being a superhero wasn’t as easy as he thought.

One evening, Oliver heard a loud crash from Mr. Puddlesworth’s bakery across the street. He saw a shadowy figure sneaking out with a bag full of stolen pastries. This was his chance to be a hero! Oliver ran outside, ready to confront the thief.

“Stop right there, evildoer!” Oliver shouted, striking what he hoped was a heroic pose.

The thief turned around, clearly unimpressed. “What are you supposed to be? A circus act?”

Oliver puffed out his chest. “I’m The Amazing Oliver! And I’m here to stop you!”

He tried to stretch his arms to grab the thief, but instead, he turned into a squirrel. The thief burst out laughing.

“Oh, this is too good,” the thief chuckled. “A superhero squirrel. I’ll give you a head start, little guy.”

Frustrated, Oliver tried to transform back, but his powers were stuck. He chased the thief in his squirrel form, scurrying up walls and leaping across rooftops. Finally, he managed to jump onto the thief’s shoulder and chomped down on his ear.

“Ouch! You crazy squirrel!” the thief yelped, dropping the bag of pastries.

The commotion caught the attention of Mr. Puddlesworth, who ran out and grabbed the thief. “Caught you red-handed!” he said triumphantly.

After the police arrived and took the thief away, Oliver finally managed to turn back into his human form. Mr. Puddlesworth was so grateful, he gave Oliver a lifetime supply of chocolate éclairs.

From that day on, Oliver decided to embrace his unpredictable powers. He might not have been the most traditional superhero, but he was definitely the most unique. With every mix-up and mishap, Oliver learned to use his strange abilities in the quirkiest ways possible, becoming Wiggleville’s beloved, if slightly chaotic, local hero.

And so, The Amazing Oliver continued his adventures, always ready to save the day—or at least make it a lot more interesting."""
